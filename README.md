# PenTracker
This is an OpenCv based pentracker which can be used for teaching purposes.

## Motivation
Tracking objects and making a projet for the visual teaching of students as less expensive as possible was the prime motive for this application. You can use a red marker(or change color depending upon availability of marker). The camera tracks the markers position and draws the curve for each found point.
